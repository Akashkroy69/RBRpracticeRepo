 * Q2. (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) 
Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.          
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,            
address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status         
(freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An  
employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined   
in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty    
member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the   
toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name
